rules:
  - name: high_ai_confidence
    when: ai_prob > 0.8
    severity: error
    message: >
      Code appears to be AI-generated with high confidence (>80%).
      Please add appropriate attribution or license information.

  - name: medium_ai_confidence
    when: ai_prob > 0.6 && !license_comment
    severity: error
    message: >
      Code appears to be AI-generated with medium confidence (>60%).
      No license or attribution information was found.
      Please add appropriate attribution or license information.

  - name: likely_ai_generated
    when: ai_prob > 0.4 && !license_comment
    severity: warning
    message: >
      Code may be AI-generated (>40% confidence).
      Consider adding appropriate attribution or license information.

  - name: poor_comment_quality
    when: ai_prob > 0.5
    severity: warning
    message: >
      The code appears to contain low-quality comments that don't adequately explain 
      the purpose and functionality of complex sections. Good comments should explain 
      "why" rather than just "what" the code is doing.

  - name: grammar_issues
    when: ai_prob > 0.3
    severity: warning
    message: >
      Grammar and spelling issues detected in comments and documentation.
      Clear, well-written comments improve code maintainability and readability.
      Consider reviewing for proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

  - name: missing_context
    when: ai_prob > 0.4 && lines_added > 100
    severity: warning
    message: >
      Substantial code additions lack sufficient contextual documentation.
      Add high-level explanations of component purposes, architectural decisions,
      and the reasoning behind implementation choices.

  - name: missing_tests
    when: ai_prob > 0.5 && !tests_changed && lines_added > 50
    severity: warning
    message: >
      Substantial code additions appear to be AI-generated,
      but no test files were modified. Please add appropriate tests.

  - name: excessive_code
    when: lines_added > 300 && ai_prob > 0.5
    severity: warning
    message: >
      Large code submission appears to be AI-generated.
      Consider breaking into smaller, more focused pull requests.
